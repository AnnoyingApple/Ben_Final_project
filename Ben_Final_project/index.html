      <p>This is a European Honey bee.</p>
        <p>It is found in almost all parts of the world.</p> 
        <p>Many people use it for farming honey to use as food.</p>
    <p>In most climates, western honey bees swarm in the spring and early summer, when there is an abundance of blooming flowers from which to collect nectar and pollen.</p>
    <p>The new queen in the original colony will be one of the daughter queens that developed from one of the daughter queen eggs laid by the mother queen before swarming. A colony can only have one queen. Once daughter queens emerge as adults, they will fight until one queen is left alive. </p>

    <p>They eat ungulates, rodents, and rabbits</p>
    <p>They are social animals</p>

    <p>This is a coypu, also known as a Nutria.</p>
    <p>They originate from South America, but have been introduced to other parts of the world such as North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia</p>
    <p>The nutria looks like a muskrat, another rodent that has been introduced out of its range. However, the nutria has a longer tail and body</p>
    <p>The nutria also resembles a rat-tailed beaver</p>
    <p>The nutria is a mostly nocturnal creature</p>
    <p>Nutria has long incisors that are yellow to orange or orange to red in color.</p>
    <p>They are herbivores with huge appetites</p>
    <p>Nutria has five fingers on front and hind feet. All fingers except one on the front feet have long nails. Webbed hind feet represent adaptation to the life near the water.</p>
    <p>Nutria digs burrows near the water or uses platforms made of dead vegetation to sleep, eat and reproduce.</p>

    <p>This is a blue tang, a marine fish</p>
    <p>This is the fish species dory from finding nemo is based on</p>
    <p>It is an omnivorous fish, feeding on plankton and algae</p>
    <p>They are found in areas of the Atlantic and Pacific ocean</p>
    <p>On reefs, the blue tang rests in narrow holes and crevices, protected from predators such as tuna, bar jacks and tiger groupers.</p>
    <p>When it is time to reproduce, regal blue tangs congregate in breeding groups. Females expel their eggs into the water above the coral, and the males expel sperm, and fertilization occurs externally. About 40,000 eggs are expelled per spawning session, according to the ADW. After spawning, the "parents" swim off, never caring about their offspring.</p>
    <p>After the release of Finding Dory, this species of fish has become popular as a pet.</p>
    <p>Despite its name, the blue tang is not always azure. It can change color at night because of the way light is reflected from the pigments in its skin, becoming “whitish with a shade of violet.”</p>

    <img src="http://www.bearsoftheworld.net/images/bears/sun_bear_standing.jpg" alt="" height: 100px width: 200px>
    <p>This is a sun bear, a small species of bear found in Southeast Asia</p>
    <p>It is also called a honey bear due to its huge appetite for honey</p>
    <p>Although they are the smallest bears, they are very aggressive and capable of mauling a person to death</p>
    <p>They have long tongues which they use to get food from small spaces.</p>
    <p>Sun bears grow to only about half the size of an American black bear. Males, slightly larger than females, are about 5 feet in length and weigh up to 150 pounds, a stature which suits their arboreal lifestyle and allows them to move easily through the trees.</p>
    <p>Because they live in tropical temperatures, sun bears do not need to hibernate and are able to mate at any time of year. Unlike North American bears, male and female sun bears may hang out or live together while raising the cubs.  Sun bears will usually have two cubs at a time and care for them for two years until they are old enough to survive on their own.</p>
    <p>Sun bears have loose skin that allows them to twist when being bitten, so as to bite an attacker.  They also have very strong legs that are great for climbing.  These characteristics help this bear protect itself from tigers and other possible predators.</p>

    <p>These are Cane toads</p>
    <p>It is a large frog native to Central and South America</p>
    <p>It has been introduced to Australia to solve invasive sugar beetle problems, but has become a pest itself</p>
    <p>It's natural predators are hawks, caimans, eels, and snakes</p>
    <p>Predators outside its range include meat ants, black rats, rakali, and crows</p>
    <p>Some animals such as the rakali and black rat are tolerable of the cane toad's toxins while others such as the meat ants are immune to its venom.</p>
    <p>They are voracious predators that will eat about anything</p>
    <p>The common name "marine toad" and the scientific name Rhinella marina suggest a link to marine life, but the adult cane toad is entirely terrestrial, only venturing to fresh water to breed.</p>
    <p>Cane toads are solitary during the night (when they search for food). They gather in groups called "knots" during the day.</p>

    <img src="https://a-z-animals.com/media/animals/images/470x370/rock_hyrax_7.jpg" alt="" height: 60px width: 30px>
    <p>This is a rock hyrax, a small mammal found in Africa.</p>
    <p>Although it may look like a groundhog or a rodent, the rock hyrax is more closely related to the elephant and manatee.</p>
    <p>It is related to the elephant since both have similar toes and internal testes predominantely in their abdomen.</p>
    <p>They have glands which are used to mark their turfs.</p>
    <p>They have three chambered stomach with bacteria to help them digest cellulose.</p>
    <p>They use, grants, wails, etc. to communicate.</p>
    <p>They are social animals, living in colonies of 50 individuals.</p>
    <p>They are omnivorous species that feed on anything they find.</p>
    <p>They mostly live in rock crevices, hence their name.</p>
    <p>Predators include big cats, hyenas, and pythons.</p>

<p>This is a kakapo, a small flightless bird found on New Zealand</p>
<p>The kakapo is the world's only flightless parrot and is unusual for its nocturnal behavior.</p>
<p>It is also the world's heaviest parrot.</p>
<p>They are critically endangered due to introduction of non-native mammals such as stoats, cats, and rats.</p>
<p>They can live up to 90 years.</p>
<p>It is mostly a ground-dwelling bird, but it can climb trees using its strong legs equipped with sharp claws.</p>
